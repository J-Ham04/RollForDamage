# RollForDamage

Roll for damage is a game created by Nicolas Gatien and Jordyn Hamilton for the GMTK 2022 Game Jam!

Jordyn was the lead programmer
Nicolas was the lead artist

We split up tasks to speed through production, so Jordyn did practically all of the programming, and Nicolas created practically all of the art.
